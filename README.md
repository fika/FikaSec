security
========

This is being developed during our voyage in a course called: Advanced Linux Security

Our goal is to have a tool that we have written ourselves to do fun stuff, instead of using ettercap or similar tools that do everything for you. We will be using existing tools, but creating our own way of calling and using them.


Please note that this is not to be used maliciously, the goal is to have something to demonstrate in a lab environment.
